RaveBot
-------

RaveBot is an iOS and Android app built on the ionic framework with a Rails backend. RaveBot allows you to manage and socially curate playlists and can be used in two ways:

1. Setting up and hosting a playlist. One device using RaveBot at a party hosts the playlist with a unique name that other users can send songs to. This device then cycles through all the songs in its database and plays them at random, along with displaying the message the song was sent with and who sent it.

2. Adding to an existing playlist. Using the unique name already set, other members at a party can search for and send songs to be added to the playlist along with a message and their name.
